Chapter 3
# Build-in Data Structes, Functions and Files

This capter discusses capabilities built into the python language that will be uses ubiquitously throughout the book. While add-on libraries like Pandas and Numpy add advanced computational functionality for larger datasets, they are designed to be used together with python's built-in data manipulation tools.

In this chapter, the autor discuss about Python's workhouse data structures:
* Tuples
* Lists
* Dicts
* Sets
* Functions

## Tuple

A tuple is fixed-length, immutable sequence of Python objects.


When you're defining tuples in more complicated expressions, it's often necessary to enclose the values in parantheses, as in this example of creating a tuple of tuples:
